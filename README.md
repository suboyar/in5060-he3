# IN5060 Home Exam 3: User Studies

This Home Exam is about statistically analyzing the study conducted by
Myrthe Erica Jeanne Tilleman at University of Oslo.

There are two files provided: `xdf2csv.py`, `main.r`. `xdf2csv.py` is
meant to parse the XDF files generated from the study, but you need
to supply these files on your own as they are too big for GitHub,
hence they are not provided in this repo. `main.r` is for performing
data manipulation, plot/table generation and statistical significance
testing. It expects two files:
`LatencyPerception/participant_experiment.csv` and
`LatencyPerception/questionnaire_data-561422-2025-11-21-1620.xlsx`. Both
of them are provided in this repo.
